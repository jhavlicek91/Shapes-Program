Shapes-Program
==============

This program is a basic version of an art program. The user has the options to draw different shapes on the screen
with their mouse after choosing from a dropdown bar what shape they want, whether or not the shape is filled in, and what color 
the shape will be. Using the drop-down bar you can also choose to delete shapes by clicking on them, save your drawing as a .png,
and read in a file in a specific format to show on the screen.
